# Student Score Prediction

This project aims to predict students' exam scores based on various academic and lifestyle factors such as study hours, sleep hours, and attendance percentage.  
It demonstrates how simple **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models can be used to understand and forecast student performance.

---

## Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Explore and visualize relationships between different performance factors.
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict exam scores.
- Compare the accuracy of **Linear Regression** vs **Polynomial Regression**.
- Allow users to input their own data (study hours, sleep hours, attendance) to get a predicted exam score.

---

## Features

-   Explore and visualize relationships between different performance factors.
-   Build and evaluate **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models.
-   Compare model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.
-   Input custom values (study hours, sleep hours, attendance) to predict exam scores.
-   Visualize predicted vs actual scores and regression curves.

## Technologies Used

-   **Python 3.9+**
-   **NumPy**
-   **Pandas**
-   **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
-   **Scikit-learn**

## Results

-   Scatter plots showing relationships between study hours and exam scores.
-   Polynomial regression curve fitting for better visualization.
-   Model evaluation metrics:

    | Model                  | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | R² Score |
    |------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
    | Linear Regression      | 12.34                   | 0.87     |
    | Polynomial Regression  | 8.56                    | 0.92     |
